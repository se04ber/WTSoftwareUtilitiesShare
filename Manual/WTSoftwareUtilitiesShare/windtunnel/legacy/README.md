## Legacy examples

These scripts are historical and mostly contain hard-coded paths from past projects.
They are kept because they document “how things were done” and can be useful as a
starting point for power users.

The original entrypoints under `windtunnel/` are now **thin wrappers** that forward
to these files, so older documentation and workflows still run.
